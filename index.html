            <h2>>Biography</h2>
            <p><b>Paramore</b> is a punk band that was formed in 2004 by musicians Jeremy Davis on bass, Hayley Williams on vocals, and Taylor York on guitar. The group originally hails from Franklin, Tennessee, where they began performing in various small venues and clubs. One year later, in 2005, they released their debut album <b>"All We Know Is Falling"</b>, which spawned three singles. 
              
              Despite achieving gold status in the UK, they did not gain the expected popularity. In 2004, the band made one of their first musical contributions by providing the soundtrack for the video game "The Sims 2" with their single "Pressure".
  
              Two years later, they composed their second album, <b>"Riot!"</b>, which brought the group greater popularity. With this album, their sales grew exponentially, reaching number 15 on the Billboard 200 chart, receiving numerous awards and certifications worldwide, including platinum status in the United States. One of their singles, "Decode", was chosen as the main theme song for the 2008 film "Twilight", in which they also included two more songs. In 2008, Paramore won the Teen Choice Awards for "Best Rock Band" and "Best Rock Song" for their song "Decode". The same year, they were nominated for a Grammy award, but did not win. They also provided music for a new video game, "Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades".
              
              A year later, the band began working on what would become their third album,<b>"Brand New Eyes"</b>, which broke all barriers and topped the charts in numerous countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Germany. The album produced five singles, achieving gold status in many countries and receiving various certifications for its quality and sales.
              
              Shortly after, in 2011, the band embarked on a new project. They released a single called "Monster", which was chosen as the soundtrack for the film "Transformers: Dark of the Moon".
              
              That same year, the group participated in the Warped Tour Festival alongside other bands and soloists.
              
              In early 2012, the group started working on their fourth studio album, which would be their fourth LP, and released the single <b>"Daydreaming"</b>. They also confirmed their participation in the Reading and Leeds Festivals for that year.
              
              Paramore is currently one of the most prominent punk bands in the music scene, serving as a reference for upcoming generations, who are looking up to the group as an example.
              
              Members of Paramore: <b>Hayley Williams (vocals), Taylor York (guitar), and Zac Farro (drums)</b>. The band has had other musicians come and go since its formation in 2004, including John Hembree, Jason Bynum, Hunter Lamb, Josh Farro, and Jeremy Davis.</p>
