                    <p> <b>We Know Is Falling</b> is the debut album by the American band Paramore, released under the
                        Fueled by Ramen label on July 26, 2005 in the United States. Its production was in charge of
                        James Paul Wisner, Mike Green, Nick Trevisick and Roger Alan Nichols. Josh Farro and Hayley
                        Williams, guitarist and vocalist for Paramore, respectively, wrote almost all the songs on the
                        album.

                        The writing process for the album took place in Orlando, Florida, and the departure of the
                        group's bassist Jeremy Davis, which occurred a few days after arriving in Orlando, served as the
                        main theme. The fact is reflected in the album cover, its title, and the song "All We Know."

                        Three singles were released from the album: "Pressure", "Emergency" and "All We Know". The
                        record received mixed reviews from music critics, who mainly praised Hayley Williams' voice.
                        However, it had a poor musical performance: it did not enter the Billboard 200, although it
                        reached number thirty on the Top Heatseekers Albums in the United States. In the United Kingdom,
                        it managed to reach fifty-one place on the UK Albums Chart in 2010 and be certified gold by the
                        BPI.

                        <b>Riot!</b> is the second studio album by the American band Paramore, released under the Fueled
                        by Ramen label on June 12, 2007 in the United States and on June 25, 2007 in the United Kingdom.
                        Its production was in charge of David Bendeth. It is considered one of the best pop punk albums
                        in history.

                        <b>Brand New Eyes</b> is the third studio album by the band Paramore, released on September 29,
                        2009. The album was produced by Rob Cavallo and recorded in Hidden Hills, California from
                        January to March 2009. The album led the charts in countries like Australia, Ireland, New
                        Zealand and the United Kingdom, making it the band's most successful release. On January 19,
                        2010, the album was certified gold in the United States for its 500,000 copies sold in the
                        country.

                        <b>Paramore</b> is the fourth self-titled studio album by the American rock band Paramore.1 It
                        was released on April 5, 2013, through Fueled by Ramen. It is their first full-length album
                        released after the departure of co-founders Josh and Zac Farro in 2010. Recorded between April
                        and November 1, 2012, the album was described by the band as a "statement" and a reintroduction
                        of the band for the world and for themselves. The album was the last recorded with bassist
                        Jeremy Davis before he left the band in 2015.

                        The album was produced by Justin Meldal-Johnsen, with guitarist Taylor York co-producing on four
                        tracks. In contrast to the band's previous work, the Paramore production contains the band's
                        experimentation with new musical genres, such as new wave and rock funk, and features three
                        acoustic interludes. Paramore received acclaim from music critics, who praised the band's
                        maturity and experimentation in terms of musicianship, as well as Williams' voice and global
                        presence on the album. Several publications include the album on their year-end lists, including
                        the A.V. Club and The Guardian.

                        Paramore was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 with
                        first-week sales of 106,000 copies. The album also topped the charts in Argentina, Australia,
                        Brazil, Ireland, and New Zealand, where it became their first album to reach the top. It also
                        became their second UK chart topper. In March 2016, Paramore was certified platinum by the
                        Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for sales and streaming in excess of
                        1,000,000.

                        Four singles have been released from the album: "Now", "Still Into You", "Daydreaming", and the
                        Grammy-winning song "Ain't It Fun". "Still Into You" and "Ain't It Fun" have been certified
                        double platinum by the RIAA in the United States, making this self-titled album the first by the
                        band to have produced more than double platinum on a single album.
